✅ Today's Progress:

  1. ✅ Fixed exit flicker - setTimeout delay solved the double-hero rendering
  2. ✅ Implemented depth-sorted tiles - TileSprite system working
  3. ✅ Fixed async rendering - TILEMAP_PARSED event ensures proper timing
  4. ✅ Depth sorting mostly working - Hero correctly goes behind/in front of tiles
  5. ✅ Tile animations supported - Animated tiles in object layers work

  🔍 To Debug Tomorrow:

  - 1-frame flicker when Hero crosses TileSprite Y-threshold
    - NPCs don't flicker (important clue!)
    - Only affects TileSprites
    - Happens when moving "around" objects

  Possible causes to investigate:
  - Y position calculation difference between NPCs and TileSprites
  - Timing of when TileSprites are added to children array
  - Sort stability when Y values are very close
  - Frame interpolation during grid movement

 hi! can you please take a look at the project? I want to tackle the 
y-sorting issue i have: there are currently 2 entities that get drawn on 
screen: 1. Game Objects - that follow the y-sorting corrreclty. 2. i have 
tile created in Tiled that we parse nad render. Now, when a game object (my 
hero) is behind a tile (e.g. a sign) we would like the sign to draw on top 
of the hero. The thing is htat we parse all the tile layers and we add the 
final renderer to the level as a child, so in the Game Object realm, the 
whole map has a single y associated making it impossible to create the depth
 effect. What can we do about this? My idea is to create a Tile game Object 
and check the immediate surroundings of the player-let's say an 8x8 area. 
Convert the tiles in that area into Game Objects and push them in the level 
children so they can follow the y-sorting logic. Waht do you think? I'm open
 to any ideas!
